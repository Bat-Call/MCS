    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Talking Heads were an American rock band formed in 1975 in New York City and active until 1991. The band was composed of David Byrne (lead vocals, guitar), Chris Frantz<br/> (drums), Tina Weymouth (bass) and Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar). Described as one of the pioneers of new wave music Talking Heads had a major impact on pop culture<br/> by creating an eccentric and quirky mix of various music genres from punk to afrobeat and world music combined with urban middle-class aesthetics. </p>
    <p>Throughout the years of activity, the band’s sound evolved from punk-spirited roughness of <em>Talking Heads’77</em> to multilayered pan-cultural fluency of <em>Fear of Music (1979)</em>,<br/> and <em>Remain in Light (1980)</em> made in collaboration with the British producer Brian Eno. </p>
    <h2 id="remain-in-light">Remain in Light</h2>
    <p><em>Remain in Light</em> is the fourth studio album of the band, released on October 8, 1980. <em>Remain in Light</em> features new wave, post-punk, worldbeat, dance-rock, art pop, art rock,<br/> avant-pop, and different types of funk, specifically afrofunk and psychedelic funk. Byrne has described the album's final mix as a "spiritual" piece of work, "joyous and ecstatic<br/> and yet it's serious"; he has pointed out that, in the end, there was "less Africanism in <em>Remain in Light</em> than we implied ... but the African ideas were far more important to get<br/> across than specific rhythms". According to Eno, the record uniquely blends funk and punk rock or new wave music. None of the compositions include chord changes, relying<br/> instead on the use of different harmonics and notes. "Spidery riffs" and layered tracks of bass and percussion are used extensively. The first side contains the more rhythmic<br/> songs, the second side features more introspective songs.</p>
    <h2 id="stop-making-sense">Stop Making Sense</h2>
    <p><em>Stop Making Sense</em> is a 1984 concert film featuring a live performance by the band. Directed by Jonathan Demme. The concert serves as a comprehensive retrospective of the<br/> band's history to that time, featuring many of their popular songs from their first hit single <em>Psycho Killer</em>, through to their most recent album. </p>
    <p>The concert begins with the lead singer David Byrne walking on to a bare stage with a portable cassette tape player and an acoustic guitar. He introduces <em>Psycho Killer</em> by<br/> saying he wants to play a tape, but in reality a Roland TR-808 drum machine starts playing from the mixing board. With each successive song, Byrne is joined by more<br/> members of the band. The energy of the performance increases, yet there are very few shots of the audience reacting to it, which is due to problems with lighting. The only<br/> direct audience shots in the film occur at the very end when <em>Crosseyed and Painless</em> culminates the performance.</p>
